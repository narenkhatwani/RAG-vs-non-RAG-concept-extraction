Climate variations, such as increased precipitation and rising temperatures, alter natural patterns and cause more severe natural events, such as storms that increase the spread of viruses [4]. More vulnerable countries, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, are more likely to suffer these impacts, increasing the mortality rate from extreme climate events [3]. It is a fact that climate effects are affecting the health of populations around the world [5], but to understand such impacts, it is necessary to differentiate three key concepts: EcoHealth, One Health, and Planetary Health [6]. EcoHealth is an older concept defined as the commitment to promoting the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems by conducting research that identifies their relationships, with a greater focus on biodiversity [7]. One Health is oriented towards biomedical issues with an emphasis on zoonoses and is defined as a holistic approach that integrates and recognizes animal, human, and environmental health [8]. Planetary Health is a more recent concept that incorporates equity into knowledge regarding health and is primarily focused on human health [7,9]. The report “The impacts of Climate Change on Human Health” defines areas of study of the relationship between climate change and health, such"

Planetary Health is a more recent concept that incorporates equity into knowledge regarding health and is primarily focused on human health [7,9]. The report “The impacts of Climate Change on Human Health” defines areas of study of the relationship between climate change and health, such as (i) Foodborne Illness and Nutrition, (ii) Health Impacts of Air Quality, (iii) Health Impacts of Extreme Climate Events, (iv) Mental Health and Well-being, (v) People Who Are Vulnerable to Climate Change, (vi) Temperature-Related Death and Illness, (vii) Vector-borne Diseases, and (viii) Waterrelated Illnesses [10]. Thus, a holistic and multidisciplinary approach is necessary to address a complex issue such as climate change, mainly since One Health addresses issues of human health, environmental health, and animal health [11]. For example, diseases such as Zika infection, Ebola virus, Lassa fever, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), and Rift Valley Fever are related to human activities [11], as is mental health [6]. However, there is still a significant gap in knowledge about the relationship between climate change and arboviruses, vector-borne diseases, and zoonotic diseases [12] and mental health [6]. The added value of the One Health perspective is that it provides an integrative framework"

The One Health approach was shown to be restricted to health-related issues. Thus, theoretical and experimental studies are still needed to assess the real impact of climate change on the various axes involving human health and its relationship with anthropogenic activities, environmental health, and animal health. Keywords: infectious diseases; mental health; social vulnerability; zoonoses; environmental effects 1. Introduction Global warming has occurred since the 1950s, increasing atmospheric temperature and affecting systems such as the ocean. Likewise, it has been causing ice melt, rising sea levels, Climate 2025, 13, 204 https://doi.org/10.3390/cli13100204 Climate 2025, 13, 204 2 of 18 and extreme climate events such as heat waves, droughts, and storms due to increased greenhouse gases [1,2]. The impacts of climate change are direct and indirect [3], affecting the environment and human health [2].
