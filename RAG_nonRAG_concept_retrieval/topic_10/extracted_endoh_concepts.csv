Of those, 418 of them had non-missing information on our identified risk factors. Specifically, the SBW traits, further described below, were only asked of 418 respondents. Thus, we have 418 respondents who meet the inclusion criteria for this study. Variables Psychosocial factors, intersectional stressors, and mental health outcomes are the variables included in our analysis and are described in the sections below. Psychosocial Factors Our study includes several psychosocial factors as controls for the final set of analyses below, all measured in Wave 3. The first is education, measured with the following question: “What is the highest grade or year of regular school you completed?” A measure of employment was included, asking respondents if they were working full time, part time, or not at all. A measure of how many months in the previous year respondents had health insurance was included as a proxy for health-related capital according to the fundamental cause theory [49]. Finally, given the literature on the importance of religiosity as a protective factor for Black women, a measure of religiosity was included, asking “How important, if at all, is your religious faith to you?”"

The interwoven impact of psychological factors and quality of life There is a complex interplay between the mental health and quality of life of head and neck cancer patients. Physiological changes, individual differences, and social environmental factors collectively shape the life experiences of these patients, profoundly impacting their mental health, as illustrated in Fig. 2. 3.1. The dual impact of physiological changes on psychology and quality of life 3.1.1. Changes in body image The treatment of head and neck cancer, such as surgery and radiotherapy, often results in signiﬁcant changes to the face and neck. Additionally, certain medications used during chemotherapy can cause hair loss, further altering the patient's appearance.40 Table 1 Trends in research on the psychological health and quality of life of head and neck cancer patients: A global perspective.

In the end, the evidence indicates that people who have direct trauma, such as being exposed to combat or losing a loved one, face more serious psy­ chological repercussions, whereas other types of trauma, such as displacement, lead to a distinct set of difficulties that are mainly char­ acterised by anxiety and depression. This advanced knowledge can assist in customising psychological treatments, with particular tactics for those who have experienced various types of trauma. Beyond the primary impacts seen in the regression analysis, it is vital to examine the ways in which combinations of factors, such as gender and exposure type or age and trauma type, affect mental health out­ comes in order to investigate interaction effects. Such analysis aids in determining whether the association between a predictor and the result varies because of another factor. Understanding interaction effects is essential to comprehending how various population subgroups may be more or less susceptible to the negative impacts of trauma on mental health. Determining whether men and women react to similar forms of trauma with the same degree of psychological suffering is crucial when examining the relationship between gender and exposure to traumatic events. For instance, earlier studies"

The responses to psychosocial stress. Stress activates the sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, where inadequate resilience leads to maladaptive behaviors and increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and autoimmune diseases. In contrast, adequate resilience, supported by coping mechanisms and social support, restores homeostasis. Chronic stress also activates the HPA axis and causes gut microbiota dysbiosis, with inadequate resilience leading to prolonged dysregulation and similar health risks, whereas adequate resilience through effective coping strategies restores homeostasis. Both types of stress highlight the importance of resilience and adaptive behaviors in mitigating adverse health outcomes. BP, blood pressure; GI, gastrointestinal; HR, heart rate.

The first, experiences of gendered racism, was measured through two Wave 4 questions, “In your day-to-day life, how often do you feel you have been treated with less respect or courtesy than other people?” For those who indicated anything other than “never,” they were subsequently asked “What do you think was the main reason for these experiences? Choose only one reason.” Of the several responses listed, we defined experiences of gendered racism for the Black women in our sample as anyone who indicated their race and gender was the main reason for their negative experience. This variable is included in our model as a binary variable wherein 1 represents respondents who indicated one of these options and"
