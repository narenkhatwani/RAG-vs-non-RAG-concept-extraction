As a result of rising exposure levels and the frequency of natural disasters, a large number of people are compelled to relocate from one location to another. This occurs because barriers to sustainable adaptation as well as human activity itself are major contributors to environmental degradation in many circumstances. From January 1-February 15, 2024, there were 292 natural disasters in Indonesia due to the impact of climate change that occurred in Indonesia. This resulted in 20 fatalities, 40 people injured, 1,099,485 suffering and 87,592 displaced, 10,994 houses damaged, 9 educational facilities damaged, and 16 health facilities damaged [47]. The implementation of sustainable adaptation measures, a lack of awareness of vulnerability, and disregard for the needs of local communities are further barriers to climate change adaptation. Other issues include inadequate program and policy integration, climate change adaptation and mitigation, and disaster risk management. A methodology for understanding how ecosystems and socioeconomic sectors mediate these linkages is proposed by Fuldauer et al. [48], providing a more comprehensive understanding of how climate change affects 169 SDG targets. The framework’s global application demonstrates that to ensure"

Billions of people and ecosystems are already suffering greatly as a result of climate change, and efforts to mitigate its effects are still falling short of what is required to stop the worst effects [8–11]. The decade from 2010 to 2019 saw the largest increase in greenhouse gas emissions in human history, according to the April Climate Change Mitigation Report. Even though there is still time to limit warming to 1.5 °C, there are strategies that can be implemented in every sector to reduce emissions [12, 14, 15]. In Indonesia, the impact of climate change has resulted in an increase in the potential for erosion, reduced wetlands along the coast, an increase in the rate of seawater intrusion, a decrease in food production, damage to infrastructure, a reduction in clean water sources, an increase in respiratory diseases, floods, droughts, and other hydrological disasters [10–12, 16, 17]. Based on the report of BNPB Indonesia (2024) during the last 5 years Indonesia has experienced various natural disasters that have caused multiple problems and damage in various cities in Indonesia, the number of natural disasters recorded in the last 5 years was 3,814 natural disasters, which caused 478 people to die,"

For instance, Bradford et al.59investigated the relationships between awareness, concern, and preparedness using responses from 13 countries across Europe. Another study examined demographic factors influencing risk perception42. Other studies has focused on trust in experts or authorities and experience62. Further studies have explored economic, demographic, and educational factors48. Empirical literature review indicated that socioeconomic characteristics, farm-level factors, and institutional elements affect individuals’ responses to flood events40,41,63. Some others have emphasized cultural factors64, social position, and preparedness for protective actions65.
