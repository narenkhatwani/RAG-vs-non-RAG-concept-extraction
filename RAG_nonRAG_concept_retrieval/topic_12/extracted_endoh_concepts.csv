E-waste has become a major problem globally due to the rapid advancement in technology and the resulting increase in the use of electronic devices as shown in Table 1. Table 1 presents various harmful materials found in e-waste. Improper disposal of e-waste can have serious implications for human health and the environment [11, 23, 32]. • One of the biggest hazards of e-waste is the release of toxic chemicals into the environment. Many electronic devices contain hazardous materials such as lead, cadmium,mercury,andbrominatedﬂameretardants.Whene-wasteisnotproperly disposedof,thesetoxicchemicalscanseepintothesoilandgroundwater,polluting drinking water and harming wildlife. • In addition to the environmental impact, e-waste can also pose a direct threat to human health. When electronic devices are broken down or recycled in unsafe conditions, workers can be exposed to toxic chemicals and heavy metals. This can lead to a range of health problems, including respiratory issues, neurological damage, and cancer.

Green transportation is not only essential for reducing carbon emissions but also for enhancing the overall functionality and livability of smart cities. 5.1 Reducing Carbon Footprint One of the primary roles of green transportation in smart cities is to reduce the carbon footprint of urban mobility. Traditional transportation systems heavily reliant on fossil fuels are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Green transportation, including electric vehicles (EVs), public transit, cycling, and walking, signiﬁcantly reduces these emissions. Electric buses and trains, for example, provide mass transit options that can move large numbers of people efﬁciently without the associated pollution of diesel-powered vehicles. 354 A. Lakshumiah et al. 5.2 Improving Air Quality Improved air quality is a direct beneﬁt of reduced emissions from green transportation. Air pollution is a critical health issue in many urban areas, contributing to respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, and premature deaths. By transitioning to electric buses, trams, and other low-emission vehicles, smart cities can reduce pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and particulate matter, leading to cleaner air and healthier residents [11]. 5.3 Enhancing Energy Efﬁciency Green transportation is"

Green Transportation and Moral Licensing: Navigating Ethical … 535 2.3 Relevance to Green Transportation: How Moral Licensing Manifests in Sustainable Practices Moral licensing can signiﬁcantly impact the effectiveness and adoption of green transportation initiatives. Understanding how this psychological phenomenon manifests in sustainable practices is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate its effects. Here are some key ways moral licensing affects green transportation: 2.3.1 Overcompensation with High-Emission Activities Individuals who adopt green transportation methods, such as cycling or using public transport, may feel justiﬁed in engaging in high-emission activities later. For instance, someone might drive a fuel-inefﬁcient vehicle for a long trip, rationalizing it by their regular use of a bicycle for commuting [9]. 2.3.2 Reduction in Overall Effort Towards Sustainability After making a single green choice, such as purchasing an electric vehicle, individuals might reduce their overall efforts towards sustainability. This can manifest as neglecting other environmentally friendly practices, such as reducing energy consumption at home or recycling, due to a perceived moral balance [34]. 2.3.3 Increased Consumption The adoption of sustainable transportation methods can lead to an increase in consumption in other areas. For example, someone who uses public transportation might justify frequent"

For example, someone who uses public transportation might justify frequent air travel, a high-emission activity, as a reward for their daily green commuting choices [21]. 2.3.4 Perceived Moral Credits Individuals might accumulate “moral credits” through consistent use of green transportation, which they then “spend” on environmentally detrimental behaviors. This concept is particularly relevant in behaviors like upgrading to a larger, less efﬁcient home or purchasing non-essential goods with high environmental costs [44]. 536 V. Pawar et al. 2.3.5 Reduced Advocacy for Broader Policy Changes Individuals who practice sustainable transportation might feel less compelled to advocate for broader systemic changes or policies. This is because they perceive their personal actions as sufﬁciently impactful, leading to complacency in supporting larger-scale environmental initiatives [50]. Moral licensing can undermine the goals of green transportation by encouraging compensatory behaviors that offset the environmental beneﬁts of sustainable practices. Recognizing and addressing these manifestations is essential for maximizing the positive impact of green transportation initiatives and fostering"

Green transportation systems provide a multi-pronged approach to environmental challenges: • Combating Climate Change: Transportation generates a considerable amount of greenhouse gas emissions, notably carbon dioxide. Green transportation alternatives quickly address this issue by transitioning to cleaner means of transportation. • Improving Air Quality: Traditional combustion engines emit pollutants that affect public health. Green transportation dramatically decreases air pollution, resulting in cleaner air and healthier communities. • Promoting Resource Conservation: Green transportation encourages the use of energy sources that are renewable, such as electricity and biofuels, to minimize reliance on ﬁnite fossil fuels and their environmental consequences. • Creating Livable Cities: Trafﬁc and noise pollution have a huge inﬂuence on metropolitan areas.

This reduction in overall sustainable behavior is a direct manifestation of moral licensing [34]. • Increased Consumption: Adopting green transportation methods can sometimes lead individuals to increase their consumption in other domains, believing that their transportation choices compensate for other unsustainable behaviors. For example, a person might purchase more goods with a high environmental cost because they feel their use of public transportation justiﬁes it [44]. • Perceived Moral Credits: Individuals might accumulate “moral credits” from consistent use of green transportation, which they then “spend” on environmentally detrimental behaviors.
