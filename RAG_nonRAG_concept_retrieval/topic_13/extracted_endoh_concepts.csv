Some even view availability as an essential prerequisite to addressing under-nutrition issues in a socio-economically sustainable manner [24]. As such, the influence of the sustainability dimension of food security on population health is mediated by multiple other dimensions such as food production (availability), malnutrition, and dietary behaviors (utilization) [25]. 3.1. Balanced Diet and Health Outcomes In the case of food security, when sustainability and all four pillars such as availability and utilization of food are in optimal states, physical and mental well-being can be more easily achieved (Figure 1), even during times of major population health challenges [26]. This applies to population wellbeing in response to diseases, as well as the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In fact, 12 or more of the 17 SDGs contain indicators for or affected by malnutrition, particularly those related to health and wellbeing [27]. The pivotal role of a balanced diet, as a result of food security, for optimal health is reflected by Sustainability 2025, 17, 874 5 of 14 findings of a recent ecologic study that explored the relationship between under-nutrition, dimensions of food security, and socio-economical development at the global level [28]."

These processes directly, indirectly, and disproportionately expose frontline, fenceline and other vulnerable communities, including Indigenous Peoples, to toxic emissions to air, water, and soil. Like all plastics, those used across food systems contain thousands of chemicals. At least 4219 of these chemicals are of concern, associated with hazardous properties like persistence, bioaccumulation, mobility and toxicity10, and/or are known to disrupt the endocrine systems of humans and other animals.

An estimated two thirds of all plastics are short-lived and the vast majority of plastic food and beverage packaging is single use13,14. During and after their intended applications, plastics and their associated chemicals contaminate the environment at staggering rates. The vast quantities of plastics used in agriculture, horticulture, aquaculture and ﬁsheries are utilised for less than one year, poorly managed, lost or discarded, constituting major sources of macro, micro and nano plastic (MNP) pollution2. While plastic pollution of marine environments has gained widespread attention, the"

While SDG 1 explicitly mentions ending poverty, nutrition plays a significant role across all the SDGs, directly or indirectly [60]. There are several causes/effects of poor nutrition that pose a threat to global development, leading to child stunting, anemia in women of reproductive age, low birth weight, childhood overweight, child wasting, and lack of exclusive breastfeeding (in the first 6 months after birth) [61]. Currently, the global malnutrition situation reveals the co-existence of undernutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and overweight/obesity in individuals, households, and populations (double-burden or as the triple burden of disease), impacting millions of people globally (21.3% under-five stunted children, 41.7% anemic individuals, 29.0% with vitamin A deficiency, 54.3% women overweight/obese, 17.0% at risk of zinc deficiency, 12.0% have inadequate iodine intakes) [61–69]. These factors have a significant combined effect on global development and health [70]. The 2024 State of the World Food Security and Nutrition Report recently revealed that as of 2023, there were 733.4 million undernourished Sustainability 2025, 17, 874 9 of 14 people globally, highlighting that most of these individuals, 52% and 40%, are in Asia and Africa [71]. This underscores the urgent need for increased commitment"

Based on the United Nations report [1], the world’s population will surpass 9.7 billion people by the year 2050, and this number is projected to climb well over 11 billion by the year 2100. If these numbers were compared to the global population nearly a decade ago (2015), there would be 53% more people requiring food and water supply in addition to medication, shelter, and education [2]. Furthermore, the demographic areas that significantly contribute to this rapid growth include the regions of Africa and South Asia, particularly individuals aged between 15 and 24 and aging populations (65 and over). Consequently, this may result in different food consumption Sustainability 2025, 17, 874 https://doi.org/10.3390/su17030874 Sustainability 2025, 17, 874 2 of 14 patterns that may affect the increase in requirements for several food items (cereals, fruit, vegetables, animal proteins) [1]. Therefore, it is evident that consumer behavior and the increase in the number of people living on the planet significantly influence the prospects of food and agriculture. This increase in the overall population also presents an increase in two very polarized sub-population extremes that contribute to"
