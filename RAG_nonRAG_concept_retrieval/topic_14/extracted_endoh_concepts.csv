A limitation of our analysis, as with all meta-analysis, is that the effects of key aspects such as dose, dose rate, or age at exposure were only measured at the level of the study. We adjusted for these and other factors for each study via meta-regression (table 2, table 4). Inevitably such meta-regressions are quite generalised, amounting to a type of ecological analysis, and might not adequately control for the effects of these factors. Many of the studies of medical exposure (supplement S3 table S3.4) had a substantial amount of information on standard lifestyle and medical risk factors for cardiovascular disease. However, information was more limited in the lower dose occupational or environmental studies (supplement table S3.5). In the lower dose studies of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors,20 Mayak workers,64-66 and a few other occupationally90-94 and environmentally exposed95 96 groups, substantial information was available on lifestyle factors (supplement S3 table S3.5). In most groups that were exposed to radiation, lifestyle risk factors had little or no evidence of interacting with cardiovascular disease risk related to radiation.13 19 20 54 56 57 59-63 67 90 91 93 95 97-99 The types of chemotherapy that were likely to"

Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42020202036 Introduction Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide.1 2 Cardiovascular disease was the underlying cause of death for about a third of the 2.8 million deaths in the USA in 2018: ischaemic heart disease accounted for 42% and stroke for 17% of all cardiovascular disease deaths.3 Worldwide, ischaemic heart disease ranks first in years of life lost and stroke ranks third. Consistently identified independent risk factors include age, smoking, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, obesity, and increased total and low density lipoprotein or decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol.4-6 A heritable genetic For numbered affiliations see end of the article Correspondence to: M P Little mark.little@nih.gov (ORCID 0000-0003-0980-7567) Additional material is published online only.

No modifying effects were reported of smoking or alcohol consumption in a cohort with peptic ulcers.13 Recorded data for lifestyle is extensive in the Life Span Study study20 (supplement S3 table S3.5) but no assessment was made of possible modifications in radiation dose-response associated with any of these risk factors. A case-control study of industrial workers at two UK nuclear plants (Sellafield and Springfield) collected information on numerous lifestyle and environmental risk factors (ie, body mass index, smoking status, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, shift work),62 as did a case-control study of French nuclear fuel cycle workers (supplement Table 2 | Meta-analysis of excess relative risk for cardiovascular diseases as a result of radiation exposure, by disease endpoint No. of study endpoints Meta excess relative risk/ Gy (95% CI) P value for heterogeneity P value residual heterogeneity I2 (%) (Hartung-Knapp 95% CI) Adjusting for endpoint Ischaemic heart disease 38 0.110 (0.053 to 0.167) 0.02 <0.001 80.00 (73.04 to 93.19) Other heart disease* 27 0.054"

As discussed above, the data56-61 do not suggest that these modify radiation risk. Nevertheless, such factors could confound the associations observed in relation to radiation exposure, although such confounding is unlikely. In some of these studies such information was collected and used in the analysis, and we give this information in supplement S3 tables S3.4-S3.6. The heterogeneity in outcomes, and how they are defined and aggregated, is a potential problem in conducting reviews of this sort. We used both incidence and mortality data, in some cases within the same cohort. Our analysis highlights differences in meta excess relative risk per Gy of these factors (table 3). Mortality data could be more reliable because disease diagnosis (by a physician knowing the patient’s history) could vary with dose. Although this issue is unlikely to affect the data"

The causes of the heterogeneity are not known, although perhaps the multiplicity of lifestyle and medical risk factors in these studies could have a role. However, little evidence exists for the modifying effect of lifestyle and medical factors on excess relative risk associated with radiation. The different target tissues or their surrogates used in specific studies (eg, whole heart, coronary artery, left anterior descending artery, lung for ischaemic heart disease, carotid, thyroid gland, salivary gland, whole brain, Willis Circle arteries for cerebrovascular disease; supplement S3 tables S3.4, S3.5, S3.6) might have differences in radiosensitivity, and this might also contribute to the heterogeneity.
