Social characteristics relate to higher exposure to heat stress and lower adaptive capacity in a context-dependent, dynamic, multidimensional, and intersectional way: • Context-dependent: Social inequalities in exposure or capacity in one setting may be very different than in another, even within the same country. • Dynamic: Inequalities may differ in specific settings (home versus workplace or school) or depending on the time of day (during a commute or at night while sleeping). • Multi-dimensional: More than one social factor will influence whether someone is more or less exposed and has higher or lower adaptive capacity. • Intersectional: Multiple social factors in combination affect someone’s exposure or adaptive capacity. For example, a low-income woman responsible for childcare in an urban setting may have much higher exposure and lower capacity than a low-income woman with no children in a rural setting. Policy recommendations General recommendations • It is essential to consider and incorporate social factors into heat-health action plans and climate change adaptation policies and interventions. • It is important to use local data to develop local solutions that are relevant for local"

For example, a study in the United Kingdom found that a higher average age was associated with higher tree canopy cover and higher area-level greenness but not with blue spaces (Zhou et al 2023). A study in Germany found that students, young professionals, and families with children had the lowest access to greenness (Sandholz et al 2021). In contrast, a study in Taiwan found that older populations had less access to greenness and greenspace, but had closer proximity to water (Shih 2022). Several studies also found that older people had more knowledge about the risks of heat and how to protect themselves from 9 Environ. Res. Lett. 20 (2025) 033005 S C Slesinski et al Table 4.

UBS refers to all the natural and man-made water surface environments in a city near city dwellers and act as public health re­ sources (Mishra et al., 2020). Blue spaces can be freshwater-enclosed bodies like lakes, ponds, rivers, seas, artificial pools, recreational areas, etc. Since most major settlements have developed near water­ bodies (Smith et al., 2021), applying UBS must be prioritized to maxi­ mize city-level cooling effects and provide sustainable urban solutions. Several global studies have highlighted how UBS can potentially augment physical and mental well-being (Hunter et al., 2023; Pasanen et al., 2019; Gupta and De, 2024a). Britton et al. (2020) evaluated thirty-three cases to conclude that blue spaces significantly positively impact urban health. A randomized crossover study on 59 adult office­ goers in Barcelona, Spain, showed that short walks around blue spaces notably boost well-being (Vert et al., 2020). Another study in Plymouth, UK, outlined that positive well-being and life satisfaction were higher after improving the quality of local beaches (van den Bogerd et al., 2021). Promoting freshwater blue health should be a part of current city planning agendas (McDougall et al., 2020). It is also necessary to plan water-resilient smart cities. Water- resilient cities"
