The complicated etiology of cancer involves lifestyle decisions, genetic predispositions, and environmental exposure [1]. Among these, exposure to the environment is increasingly understood to be a major factor in cancer risk and to be responsible for a large amount of the cancer burden worldwide. Public health is increasingly at risk due to the accelerated rate of industrialization, urbanization, and lifestyle changes that have increased exposure to several environmental carcinogens [2]. Occupational hazards, air and water pollution, and lifestyle factors including exercise and nutrition are some of the most researched environmental exposures associated with cancer. For example, there is evidence linking air contaminants such as benzene, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5) to lung cancer and other cancers. There is a connection between drinking water contaminants, such as arsenic and industrial chemicals, and bladder, liver, and skin malignancies. Additionally, workers in particular industries have a much higher chance of developing various malignancies due to occupational exposure to substances like asbestos, silica, and certain pesticides. In addition to environmental exposures, lifestyle variables such as drinking, smoking, and eating habits might raise one’s risk of developing cancer [3]. It is essential to comprehend the processes by which these"

As climate change accelerates, these risks are likely to increase, exacerbating health disparities. This Topic focused on quantifying these effects, developing exposure models, and advancing tools to support public health interventions, particularly in the context of children's development and older adults' chronic conditions. This Research Topic presents a collection of studies that explore the impact of environmental factors on children's health. Li et al. conducted a nationwide study involving 32,000 children in China and found that 4.1% had elevated blood lead levels. Risk was significantly higher among children exposed to poor air quality and secondhand smoke (Li et al., 2025). Bao et al. analyzed time-series data on pediatric asthma hospitalizations in Eastern China. Although seasonal trends were evident, no consistent association was found with air pollution, suggesting other mediating factors may influence hospitalization risk (Bao et al.,"

This review also discusses the differences in cancer risk associated with environmental exposures among various populations, highlighting the necessity of focused preventative and therapeutic measures. The results highlight how crucial it is to implement public health programs and regulatory regulations targeted at lowering environmental carcinogen levels and lessening their influence on the incidence of cancer. Considering an emphasis on developing precision medicine techniques and enhancing environmental health equality, future research directions are suggested further to clarify the complex links between the environment and cancer.
