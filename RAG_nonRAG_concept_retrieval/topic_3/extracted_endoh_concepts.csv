The World Health Organization (WHO) states that “housing should provide protection against communicable diseases, protection against injury, poisoning and chronic diseases and reduce psychological and social stress to a minimum” [2]. Housing factors have been shown to have an effect on an individual’s state of physical, mental, social and economic well-being [3]. Housing is a place in which a group of individuals spend more than 80% (3/5) of their time for daily activities, which can be somewhere between 15.5 and 15.7 h per day [4,5]. Housing is seen as a “key determinant of health” as it is stated, “good housing and good health go together” [6]. Breysse et al. (2004) reported housing as a neglected site for public health action [7]. The indoor environment comprises the fundamental environmental factors that affect the health, wellbeing and productivity of the occupants [8]. The consequence on health Eng.

Community led housing  health and wellbeing  a comprehensive literature review.pdf,0.5450025200843811,"ventilation, indoor space, proximity to green space, proximity to local facilities, proximity to public transport, proximity to active transport options, indoor cold exposure, indoor air pollutants","and quality of homes on the health of occupants has been widely reported for numerous outcomes including cardiorespiratory diseases, infectious diseases, injuries, allergies and mental health conditions (Ige et al., 2019; WHO, 2018). Causal pathways have shown how housing can impact on health. These pathways can be used to infer how risk factors at the building level (e.g., ventilation and space), the neighbourhood level (e.g., proximity to green space, local facilities and public and active transport options) and through direct expo­ sures (e.g., cold or air pollutants) (Bird et al., 2018; Pineo et al., 2018), can have health impacts. As well as physical environments, psychosocial envi­ ronments (e.g., affordability, safety, environmental sustainability, and social contact) play a role in health outcomes (Bird et al., 2018; Ige et al., 2019; WHO, 2018). These causal pathways underpin the methods of this paper.To date, there has been little comprehensive assessment of the health impacts of housing arrangements where people intentionally live or work together in a community (Lubik & Kosatsky, 2019). Community Led Housing definition Community Led Housing (CLH) is an umbrella term encompassing several non-profit models of housing delivery.

Of note, certain groups are more likely to experience adverse health outcomes associated with poor housing conditions, including older adults, women, children, Indigenous peoples, people living in low socioeconomic areas, and people with chronic health conditions (Lien and Tabata, 2022; Sly, 2021; Standen et al., 2022). Housing conditions can influence the health impacts of climate change by reducing or increasing exposure to environmental hazards caused by climate change (Hales et al., 2007). However, housing is a complex area, and modifications may lead to unintended consequences which can worsen rather than improve health outcomes, e.g., increasing air tightness with the aim of preventing heat loss may increase indoor airborne hazards (Macmillan et al., 2016; Shrubsole et al., 2014). The relationships between housing conditions and health, and climate change and health, are separately well-researched (Rocque et al., 2021; Alidoust and Huang, 2021). However, to date, the availability of evidence on the role of housing conditions in the associations between climate change and health is unclear. To address this critical knowledge gap, and the need for evidence to inform adaptation policies, we conducted a scoping review of existing"

Time spent indoors may be increasing due to extreme weather conditions (Gronlund et al., 2018). In addition, housing conditions contribute to poor health outcomes through a range of pathways, including dampness and mould (Knibbs et al., 2018), indoor air pollution (Adamkiewicz et al., 2011), poor housing quality (Alidoust and Huang, 2021), and excessive hot or cold temperatures (Jacobs, 2011). Improvements to housing conditions have been found to result in positive health outcomes (Jacobs et al., 2010). The positive and negative impacts of housing conditions affect many areas of human health, including respiratory disease, mental health conditions, and skin and eye conditions, as well as general health (Thomson et al., 2013). Of note, certain groups are more likely to experience adverse health outcomes associated with poor housing conditions, including older adults, women, children, Indigenous peoples, people living in low socioeconomic areas, and people with chronic health"
