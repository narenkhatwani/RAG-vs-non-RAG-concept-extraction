Only one study focused on blue spaces in the context of flood risk, considering water coverage and proximity to rivers in slums (Gruebner et al., 2012) (Table 3). Studies addressed health and well-being in different ways and often multiple outcome categories were analysed. Physical health (n=25, 89%) received the most attention, followed by mental health (n=17, 61%), and social health (n=10, 36%). Of all 28 studies, 13 studies (46%) addressed health and well-being in-depth. Aspects of physical activities (Kabisch & Kraemer, 2020; Murtagh & Frost, 2023), thermal comfort (Halbmayer et al., 2021; Tarpani et al., 2023), heat-related health risks (Huang et al., 2021; Lanza et al., 2023), emotional balance (Du et al, 2021; Lanza et al., 2021), cognition (Duan, 2018), life satisfaction (Arifwidodo & Chandrasiri, 2020; Gruebner et al., 2012) and social interactions (Raney et al., 2023; Yung et al., 2019) were examined. While all included studies focused on vulnerable population groups, the specific study populations varied. Low-income populations (n=18, 64%),"

This may point to a gap in research on the specific impacts of air pollution on women. Lowincome communities face increased exposure due to proximity to pollutant sources and substandard housing. The results further indicated that of the health impacts experienced by vulnerable populations, general health issues (96%) and respiratory health issues (89%) are the most prominent health impacts. Conclusions: The study underscores the need for stricter air quality regulations, public education, and an integrated social–environmental approach to mitigate exposure in vulnerable populations.

Introduction Air pollution is a significant public health issue, accounting for 8.1 million deaths worldwide in 2021, making it the second most important risk factor globally for mortality [1]. Air pollution is particularly of concern in developing countries where vulnerable populations face heightened exposure due to socio-economic and environmental factors [2]. In 2019, air pollution was responsible for approximately 7 million premature deaths worldwide, with 91% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries [3]. A developing country such as South Africa,"

Moreover, the reliance on solid fuels for cooking and heating in low-income households significantly contributes to indoor air pollution, which predominantly affects women and children [21]. The studies that did focus on women, particularly pregnant women, such as a study by Mitku et al. (2023) revealed their increased vulnerability to air pollution, including risks of poor birth outcomes and developmental issues in children [22]. Studies that concentrated on low-income women and children demonstrated the compounded vulnerability experienced by these groups, where socio-economic status and demographic factors intersect to exacerbate health inequalities related to air pollution exposure. The studies also emphasized that socio-economic disparities, such as limited access to healthcare and inadequate housing, further exacerbate the health risks associated with air pollution. Studies that focused on low-income women and children demonstrated the compounded vulnerability experienced by these groups, where socio-economic status and demographic factors intersect to exacerbate health inequalities related to air pollution exposure. For example, a study by Shezi et al. (2021) found that pregnant women in low-socio-economic households in Durban had a higher incidence of adverse birth outcomes, including low birth weight and preterm births, due to exposure to indoor"

Shezi et al. (2021) found that maternal exposure to indoor PM2.5 in low-socio-economic households in Durban was associated with a higher incidence of low birth weight and preterm births [23]. Christensen et al. (2022) found cognitive development issues linked to in utero exposure to pollutants [57]. Wright et al. (2023) called for further research on the risk of orofacial cleft lip/palate due to maternal ambient air pollution exposure [58]. These findings underscore the compounded vulnerability of pregnant women in low-income communities, where both indoor and outdoor air pollution contribute to adverse health outcomes [59]. These studies highlighted the significant health burden of air pollution on adults in these communities [6,23], exacerbated by socio-economic factors such as limited access to healthcare and inadequate housing. 3.6. Mitigation Measures Many of the studies reviewed (see Figure 5) emphasized the need for stricter environmental regulations (36%) to limit emissions from industrial sources and promote cleaner household energy alternatives. For example, Ngamlana et al. (2024) highlighted the significant impact of coal-fired power plants on ambient air quality in the Mpumalanga province and recommended the implementation of stricter emission standards and regular monitoring"

While our scoping review aimed at identifying what approaches and methods have been used to study the links between positive effects of urban green and blue spaces, health and well-being, and vulnerable population groups in the context of extreme climate events, the included studies (n=28) did not exclusively consider positive effects. Two included studies also addressed negative health effects such as infectious diseases and adverse mental health (using tree approaches, see Gruebner et al., 2012) and well-being effects of flooding (using two approaches, see Duan et al., 2018). 3.3 Links between the topics covered 3.3.1 Health and well-being promotion The reviewed literature reveals that green and blue spaces promote physical, mental and social health and well-being among vulnerable population groups. This link reflects nature’s non-material contribution to health and unfolds through two interconnected pathways: the physical, mental and social experiences these spaces afford, and their role in regulating extreme climate events. Green and blue urban fabrics provide spaces for experiences that promote health across physical, mental and social dimensions. Physical health is enhanced through physical activities such as walking, exercising, playing and gardening. These behaviours are encouraged by intrinsic motivations"

We dearly thank the designers of icons that we used for our Inclusive Climate and Health Resilience Framework for Urban Spaces and for our map, kindly provided through Flaticon.com. 1 Introduction Green and blue spaces, such as parks, forests, rivers, lakes and other waterways hold benefits for human health. Growing evidence particularly indicates the positive effects on our physical, mental and social health and well-being (Ekkel & de Vries, 2017; Föllmer et al., 2020; McDougall et al., 2024; Völker & Kistemann, 2011). They are linked to health and well-being through different pathways (Markevych et al., 2017). Natural elements in these spaces can reduce stress, fatigue, and mental exhaustion through attention restoration and stress reduction (Barakat & Yousufzai, 2020; Gascón et al., 2015; Kaplan, 1995; Kaplan & Kaplan, 1989; Ulrich et al., 1991). Furthermore, they promote physical activity, social interaction, and nature connectedness to build health capacity (Andreucci et al., 2019; Hunter et al., 2023). Vegetation and water elements in build environments, such as street trees or fountains can reduce population exposure to climate events, as these elements absorb heat and water, with vegetation providing 4 cooling effect"
