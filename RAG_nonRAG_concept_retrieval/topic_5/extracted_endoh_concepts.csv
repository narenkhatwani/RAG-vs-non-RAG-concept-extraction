For example, several large-scale epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that exposure to gaseous pollutants (eg, ozone) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) increase the risk of all-cause and cardio‐ vascular mortality.8-11 Other environmental burdens, such as exposure to toxic metals and industrial waste, transportation noise pollution, and lack of recreational facilities and green spaces for regular exercise, have each been associated with worse health outcomes.12-15 However, little is currently known about the cumu‐ lative and collective impact of these environmental burdens on the neighborhood-level prevalence of car‐ diovascular risk factors and diseases. In addition, despite evidence that certain environmental factors, such as air pollution exposure, disproportionately affect low-income and high-proportion racial and ethnic mi‐ nority communities,16-18 it is unclear if there are significant interactions between environmental burden and social vulnerability. Understanding the collective influence of neighborhood environmental burdens on cardiovascular health and how these associations vary by social vulnerability could inform targeted efforts by health systems, public health leaders, and other sectors to address these hazards and improve cardio‐"

Conclusions and Relevance In this cross-sectional study of US neighborhoods, cumulative environmental burden was associated with higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, although absolute dif‐ ferences were small. The strongest associations were observed in socially vulnerable neighborhoods.

Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the US.1 Socially vulnerable communities ex‐ perience a disproportionately higher burden of cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, driven in part by social determinants of health, such as poor access to care, inadequate housing, and food insecurity.2-5 In addition to these social risk factors, there is growing concern around the influence of environmental risk factors on cardiovascular health.6,7 Previous studies have focused on the contributions of individual environmental exposures on health out‐ comes.

Patel, BS3; Renee N. Salas, MD, MPH, MS2,4,5,6 ; et al Author Affiliations | Article Information Question Across US neighborhoods, is there an association between cumulative environmental burden and cardiovascular health? Findings In this cross-sectional study of 71 659 US Census tracts, neighborhoods in the top quartile of en‐ vironmental burden experienced significantly higher rates of cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, dia‐ betes, and obesity) and diseases (coronary heart disease and stroke) compared with those in the bottom quartile. The association between environmental burden and cardiovascular health was more pronounced in socially vulnerable neighborhoods. Meaning The findings of an association between neighborhood environmental burden and worse cardio‐ vascular health, especially in socially vulnerable communities that are also disproportionately exposed to these conditions, indicate that future studies should investigate the impact of addressing environmental hazards on cardiovascular health.

The association between cumulative environmental burden and cardiovascular health has important clinical and public health implications. The World Health Organization estimates that 35% and 42% of global dis‐ ability adjusted life years due to ischemic heart disease and stroke are attributable to modifiable environ‐ mental risks, respectively.26 Our findings reveal significant variation in cumulative environmental burden (air pollution, hazardous and toxic sites, poor built environment, transportation infrastructure, and water Discussion  Sections       PDF  Share 11/9/25, 12:50 AM Neighborhood Environmental Burden and Cardiovascular Health in the US | Obesity | JAMA Cardiology | JAMA Network https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamacardiology/fullarticle/2811980 14/25 pollution) across US neighborhoods and underscore the role these hazards collectively play as determi‐ nants of cardiovascular health.

Green spaces Exposure to nature such as parks, trails or vegetation, or smaller scale presence of nature like trees planted along streets or in other public places can have positive effects on children’s well-being (Lovasi et al., 2008[61]). Studies point to a multitude of positive associations between exposure to nature and child outcomes, such as reduced mortality, reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, weight gain, obesity and diabetes, reduced symptoms of disorders like ADHD, higher levels of physical health, cognitive development, self-discipline, stress moderation, and improved feelings of safety, the emotional state and life satisfaction (Mouratidis, 2021[62]; McCormick, 2017[63]; Faber Taylor and Kuo, 2011[64]; Balseviciene et al., 2014[65]; Xing et al., 2023[66]). Nature may also benefit children through indirect effects on their birthparent. Access to nature during pregnancy has been associated with a decreased risk for low birth weight and consequently a reduced risk for a number of health complications across the child’s life (Islam, Johnston and Sly, 2020[67]). The effect of nature seems to be heterogenous, depending on other neighbourhood aspects and individual child characteristics. For example, Sandy et al. (2013[68]) find that the usage of larger parks or trails and thus their beneficial"
