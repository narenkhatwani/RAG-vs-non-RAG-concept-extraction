While the human traits studied are distinct from disease vulnerability, such attributes do contribute to the overall health state of an individual. Other studies have identified environmental factors as significant contributors to disease, yet the specific exposures of concern are poorly defined. The need remains for a concerted and organized effort to systematically evaluate environmental contributors to health and disease (Lichtenstein et al. 2000; Willett 2002). Christopher Wild coined the term exposome and defined it as the totality of our exposures from conception onward (Wild 2005); Miller and Jones (2014) refined this definition to include “the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan.” Exposures come from our external environment and lifestyle (e.g., diet, stress, smoking, chemicals, drugs, microbes) and are also the result of our internal biological processes and metabolism that generate new biological intermediates (Rappaport and Smith 2010). Through understanding the internal processes in the context of external exposures, interventions can be made at both the individual and societal level to mitigate health risks (Smith et al. 2015).

Susceptible populations Exposure to O3 may induce cardiovascular health eﬀects to diﬀerent levels for populations with diﬀerent susceptibilities. Research on suscep- tible populations helps to elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms of air pollution and to establish air quality standards [63] . 2.2.1. Age Children are more vulnerable to air pollution exposure than adults because they are in the stage of development. An increase of O3 exposure at 1-day moving average was associated with more changes in cardio- vascular function among children [ 104 , 105 ], compared to the elderly [106] and adults [107] . The eﬀects of O3 exposure during childhood may predispose these children to earlier development of cardiovascular pathologies and disease in later life [108] . In elderly people, physiological and metabolic changes weaken the body’s defense ability to respond to environmental stress, thus increas- ing sensitivity to pollution [109] . Stratiﬁed analysis showed that the risk of cardiovascular death [ 22 , 24 ], stroke [ 64 , 69 ], prehypertension [90] , and venous thromboembolic disease were more strongly associ- ated with O3 exposure in elderly people than younger"

Over the past few decades, efforts to understand environmental contributors have not been as robust. Research has clearly established that the environment plays a significant role in our health and in the development of disease, and comprehensive studies of genetic variants and disease have been conducted to reveal links between environmental exposures and health outcomes (Doll and Peto 1981; Remington and Brownson 2011). For example, a recent meta-analysis of heritability of human traits from more than 10,000,000 twin pairs determined that 49% of the variation was genetic in origin (Polderman et al. 2015) with up to 51% of the variation potentially associated with the environment. While the human traits studied are distinct from disease vulnerability, such attributes do contribute to the overall health state of an individual.

Through understanding the internal processes in the context of external exposures, interventions can be made at both the individual and societal level to mitigate health risks (Smith et al. 2015). The study of the exposome provides the opportunity for the research community to develop and apply existing tools that allow a comprehensive evaluation of environmental factors that can be used in coordination with efforts to study genetic factors in health and disease (Cui et al. 2016). Complementary tools and approaches to study both the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to disease have the potential to revolutionize biomedical science. From a human health perspective, we are mostly concerned with those exposures that are associated with adverse health outcomes. Thus, it is not the presence of the chemicals per se that is the concern, but how those chemicals are altering our biology. Such effects could include binding to macro­ molecules, inducing structural changes (e.g., DNA mutation, adducts, epigenetic modifications) and disruption of enzyme function, or damage via reactive oxygen or nitrogen species.
