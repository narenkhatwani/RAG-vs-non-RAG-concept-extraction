Mounting evidence suggests that environmental causes are predominant risk factors in clinical conditions, such as ischemic heart disease, lung disease and most cancers1. Complementing genomic research, the study of how genetic changes and predispositions affect gene product functions which may lead to disease, by taking the holistic environmental inﬂuences into account is key to bridging the gap between the knowledge of underlying disease mechanisms and epidemiology2–4. The exposome paradigm was ﬁrst introduced by Wild in 2005, and is deﬁned as the multitude of exposures an individual experiences throughout a lifetime5. This encompasses an exceptional variety of dynamic external factors that include environmental-, diet-, social- and lifestyle inﬂuences, and associated biological responses; all of which impart speciﬁc ﬁngerprints on our internal environment6. Exposure to certain man-made and naturally occurring chemicals has long been recognized as a prime risk factor. These xenobiotics have the potential to enter an organism through diet, water, air, cosmetics, personal-care products, plastics, anti-microbial products and many other sources7. However, while genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were enabled by technical advancements in the past, the required tools to establish an environmental counterpart are still missing to date2.

In a 2016 systematic review, Appleton et al. examined the interplay between environmental and social stressor exposures in relation to several commonly assessed childhood health outcomes, including cognition and behavior.30 The researchers found evidence supporting the conclusion that social and environmental risks operate jointly to aﬀect child health. In addition, they observed that air pollution (AP) was the most commonly studied environmental exposure, whereas socioeconomic status (SES) was the most commonly studied social exposure.30 In a 2016 review, Ruiz et al.31 identiﬁed a wide range of social and environmental exposures associated with children’s cognitive health. In 2019, Barrett and Padula reported on epidemiological literature (published since 2015) regarding joint impact of chemical and nonchemical stressors on pregnancy and child development outcomes. Although they excluded studies of AP and heavy metals, these authors concluded that stronger associations with adverse health outcomes occur when chemical and nonchemical stressors are combined.32 However, no systematic or scoping reviews have been conducted speciﬁcally on children living in the United States to examine both exposure disparities and the joint eﬀects of combined exposures of environmental neurotoxicants and social disadvantage as they relate to disparities in neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Review disabilities and loss of intelligence, poor impulse control, developmental delays, hearing impairment, ADHD, and autism, any of which can aﬀect a child’s potential with long-term consequences for mental and behavioral health in adulthood.21–23 Further, mounting evidence shows that social conditions can modify associations between environmental contaminant exposures and neurodevelopment.23 For example, poverty, maternal material hardship, and poor diet have been shown to heighten the toxic eﬀects of air pollutants and other chemical exposures on cognitive functioning of children.24–30 The cumulative impacts of exposures to these chemicals and social inequities present dangers not only for today’s children but also for future generations. Despite growing concerns about cumulative environmental health risks/impacts and the relationship with health disparities, to our knowledge only three previous reviews have examined how neurodevelopmental outcomes in children are impacted by exposures to environmental contaminants and social disadvantage. In a 2016 systematic review, Appleton et al. examined the interplay between environmental and social stressor exposures in relation to several commonly assessed childhood health outcomes, including cognition and behavior.30 The researchers found evidence supporting the conclusion that social and environmental risks operate jointly to"

The broad overview provided by a scoping review also enabled us to identify major gaps in the literature. A unique strength of our review is characterizing the conceptualization and operationalization of race, ethnicity, and SES, for example, by study authors. This kind of assessment is rarely done in systematic reviews of environmental epidemiological studies investigating environmental health disparities. However, because we did not conduct a systematic review, we could not formally assess the quality of the included studies or conduct a quantitative meta-analysis. It may be helpful to compare our ﬁndings to relevant previous reviews. Ruiz et al., examined >100 chemical and nonchemical stressors from the built, natural, and social environments on children’s cognitive ability.31 Although the authors aﬃrmed the adverse eﬀects of Pb, they observed inconsistent results for most exposures, including AP [PAHs and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)], PBDEs, Phth, and pesticides. In contrast, our present review found more studies showing evidence for adverse eﬀects of these contaminants on cognitive outcomes than did Ruiz et al.31 This may be the result of differences in our search terminology and eligibility criteria. Ruiz et al. identiﬁed 258 eligible studies examining cognitive outcomes, whereas"

We identiﬁed several key points: a) the need for better reporting on and the interpretation of eﬀect modiﬁcation and interaction, b) the importance of exposure disparities, c) the need for improving the use of race and other variables to denote social group diﬀerence in environmental epidemiology studies, and d) the need for more research examining impacts of neurotoxicant exposures into later childhood and adolescence. Interpretation of Effect Modification and Interaction in the Context of Environmental Health Disparities The traditional approach in environmental epidemiology for answering the question of “who is more harmed?” is to examine the statistical signiﬁcance and magnitude of an interaction term between the chemical and social comparator (sometimes called social stressors) and/or to conduct analysis stratiﬁed by the social comparators of interest (or their proxy). The practice and reporting of these types of analyses has come under some criticism,254 especially with regard to research on health disparities by race and ethnicity.38,43,255,256 Kauﬀman and MacLehose noted that one of the most “egregious improprieties is to assert"
