AOPs effectively degrade MPs and associated pollutants but are energy-intensive, making them viable mainly for high-priority contamination sites. While precise cost estimates remain challenging due to site-specific variables and technological heteroge­ neity, this comparative analysis highlights key economic considerations that should guide the selection and optimization of remediation strate­ gies for large-scale applications. Finally, the ecological and health implications of MPs are multifac­ eted. While their adverse effects on aquatic life are well documented, comprehensive risk assessments regarding human health remain elusiv. While studies suggest that humans may ingest between 0.1 and 5 g of plastic per week through food and water (Catarino et al., 2021), more research is needed to understand the full health risks associated with MPs. Public perceptions of MPs, often driven by fragmented informa­ tion, can lead to misinformed policies. Rigorous, transparent science communication is essential to contextualize research findings and avoid unnecessary alarm (Catarino et al., 2021). This will aid in developing informed policies that mitigate MPs’ environmental and health impacts without causing disproportionate public concern. 7.

Meanwhile, establishing the threshold concentration of MPs that causes harm to organisms and ecosystems is crucial for ecological risk assessment. The toxicity of MPs is influenced by factors such as species diversity, particle size, and polymer type. Recent studies suggest that the hazard assessment of MPs may be overestimated when based on raw, unweathered MPs, as the toxicity of weathered MPs is significantly lower (Cui et al., 2024). Therefore, determining accurate threshold values for MPs in aquatic ecosystems is essential for understanding their ecological risks and formulating effective environmental policies. 5.3. Human health risk assessment MPs also pose potential risks to human health, primarily through ingestion, inhalation, or dermal exposure (Prata et al., 2020). MPs can act as carriers for toxic chemicals, affecting human physiological sys­ tems such as the digestive, respiratory, and circulatory systems. Adverse health effects associated with MPs exposure include endocrine disor­ ders, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases (Choi et al., 2023). Studies have detected MPs in human feces, and"

MPs also pose severe health risks, including oxidative stress, genotoxicity, reproductive impairments, and organ inflammation [113]. These effects are particularly concerning for children and infants, who are more susceptible to disruptions in cell proliferation, neurodevelopment, and immune system function [112,114,115]. 5.8. Impact as a Whole in the Food Chain In summary, microplastics influence all components of the aquatic food chain, with subsequent consequences for human health. Their impacts include physical harm, neurotoxicity, cellular damage, immune system disruption, and other adverse effects (Figure 3). Figure 3. Impact of microplastic. This figure depicts the impacted group in the food chain by microplastic and the impacts by the microplastic to these groups. 6. Recommendations and Policies for Minimizing Microplastic Pollution in Inland Waters Microplastic (MP) pollution in inland water bodies is a pressing environmental issue that requires immediate attention. The authors have outlined key recommendations and policies aimed at reducing microplastic pollution in these aquatic ecosystems. • Reduction from source and Plastic Waste Management: Preventing plastics from entering water bodies is vital. Government should enforce bans on single-use plastics (e.g., straws, bags) and promote biodegradable alternatives and plastic-free packaging and usage. Improved waste management systems are"

The most frequently detected polymer types were: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in tap water, and PE, PP and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) in bottled water. A strong correlation was observed (r ¼ 0.68, P ¼ 0.049) between the plastic cap material (PE) and the predominant polymer type in the bottled water. In terms of morphology, fragments and ﬁbres were the most abundant MPs, together constituting 92 % and 96 % of MPs detected in tap and bottled water samples, respectively. Using EFSA (European Food Safety Authority) recommended daily water intakes, the corresponding exposures to MPs in different UK age groups were estimated. On a body weight (BW) basis, infants and toddlers were exposed (4 MP/kg BW/day) at a higher level than adults (1 MP/kg BW/day). This raises concern, given the former's incompletely developed immune/nervous systems rendering them at higher risk of adverse health effects from such exposure. © 2024 The Authors.
